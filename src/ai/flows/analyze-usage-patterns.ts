// This file will be deleted. Its content is moved and significantly changed in analyze-session-insights.ts
// For the purpose of this operation, imagine this file is now deleted.
// If a file is to be deleted, simply do not include a <change> block for it with new content.
// However, since the tool might expect a change, I'm putting a placeholder.
// In a real scenario, this would be a delete operation on the filesystem.
// This file is intentionally left blank as it's being replaced.
